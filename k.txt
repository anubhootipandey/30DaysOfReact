******************************REDUX***************************
-----------------WHAT IS REDUX?------------------
1.A Pattern: it means we can do things in a sequence.
2.A Library
3.Independent of Frameworks: it can be used alone and we cam use it in frontend and backened and even used in any mobile apps.
4.State management in JS

----------------------WHY REDUX USED IN REACT?-----------------------
This is because React only allows for a uni-directional flow of data. That means data cannot be sent from a child 
to a parent; it has to flow downward from the parent to the child. This thought model works very well with Redux 
where we cannot directly modify the state. Instead, we dispatch actions that intend to change the state, and then 
separately, we observe the resulting state changes.
